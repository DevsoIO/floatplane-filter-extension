I built this extension, one to learn how to build
a chrome extension, but also, having recently
signed up to Linus Tech Tips (LTT) on Floatplane, I
mostly wanted to see the Floatplane exclusive content,
as I've watch most of LTT via YouTube. 

Floatplane currently doesn't have any way of filtering 
between the different LTT channels so I built this 
extension to provide the filtering.

## Limitations
As mentioned above, I built this specifically for LTT
as they upload all of their different YouTube channels
to Floatplane, but there is no way to filter them out
from the Floatplane exclusive. This means, this extension
only works specifically on LTT channel, and therefore
this won't work on other channels within Floatplane. 

## Disclaimer
This project is developed solely by myself 
(Chris Board - Devso (https://devso.io)), this is in
no way affiliated with Float Plane or Linus Tech Tips.
Please do not contact them for any issues with this
extension.
